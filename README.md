## Description

Divisional Secretariat Office has 9 sections as ආයතන, ගිනුම් අංශය, සංවර්ධන අංශය, ඉඩම් අංශය, සමාජ සේවා අංශය, දිවි නැගුම අංශය, ක්ෂේත්‍ර, ලියාපදිංචි අංශය and මුදල් හා චෙක්පත් අංශය. The Postal mail managing division daily receive letters belongs to the above sections. The duty of the division which collect letters is to store the details of the letters and distribute those to the other 9 sections. At present, Division keeps track of details of all letters by writing on a book and manually seperate the letters and distribute those to the relevant sections. This makes the process complicated when there is a necessity to search a letter. This project is carried out to automate the activities in the Postal Mail Managing Division.
